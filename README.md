# Database-Systems

This project contains a comprehensive database for vaccination data of the unified health system (SUS) of Brazil, modeled in ERWin and migrated to an equivalent SQL in Microsoft SQL Server.
Additionally, it includes a RESTful API built using Node.js for seamless integration of the database with other applications.

This repository aims to provide a reliable, efficient, and scalable database system to manage vaccination data, which is critical for public health management.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:

Database schema: The database schema is designed using ERWin and migrated to SQL using the "forward engineering" option in Microsoft SQL Server. The schema includes tables, relationships, constraints, and indexes for efficient data management.

RESTful API: The RESTful API is built using Node.js and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the database. The API supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and allows clients to access and manipulate data securely.

It is primary based on the principles of Fundamentals of Database Systems by Elmasri and Navathe.
